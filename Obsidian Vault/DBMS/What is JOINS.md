SQL Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

### **Types of SQL Joins**

1. **Inner Join:** The most basic type of join, it returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
    
2. **Left Join:** Returns all rows from the left table and only the matched rows from the right table.
    
3. **Right Join:** Returns all rows from the right table and only the matched rows from the left table.
    
4. **Full Outer Join:** Returns all rows from both tables, regardless of whether there is a match.
    
5. **Self Join:** Joins a table to itself, allowing you to compare data within the same table.
