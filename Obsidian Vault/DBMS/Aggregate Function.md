[[WHAT IS DATABASE|MySQL]]'s aggregate function is used to **perform calculations on multiple values and return the result in a single value like the average of all values,** the sum of all values, and maximum & minimum value among certain groups of values. We mostly use the aggregate functions with [SELECT statements](https://www.javatpoint.com/mysql-select) in the data query languages.
